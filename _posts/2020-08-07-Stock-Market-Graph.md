# Let's see what Graphs like above represents?

As we know from the previous post, all transactions of buying and selling of shares takes place in Stock Exchange itself with help of stock brokers. So our Stock Exchange knows the prices of a particular share in which it has been sold to buyers. It has entire records of past and present prices on which a share of company has been exchanged. Also, stock market updates the last price on which a particular stock has been sold. The stock market continuously updates the last price of shares on which they have been sold. This has become easy and fast today with computers and internet. This latest price at which share is sold is called ‘LAST TRADED PRICE’ (LTP). Now, it’s difficult to read updated share prices of companies in simple text and so our stock market makes graphs of price v/s time of each and every company’s share price. In this graph, Y-axis represent last traded price of share and X - axis represent the time axis.

## Example

Imagine a stock price graph of some company look like this:

The red dot is coinciding point of price and time. On, 26th of March, the price at which share of company is traded is 295.5 rupees. But, as shares are traded in stock market every second, so the time interval on X-axis varies. In our case the time interval is 1 day. But the time interval can be of 3 minutes, 1 hour, may be in seconds also. If time interval is in minutes, that means the updated price is seen and graph is drawn after every fixed minutes.

For e.g. this graph of gets updated every 5 minutes. On a particular date, this graph show share prices from 10:00 am and get update every 5 minutes after that.

As share price changes continuously every moment, graphs are used.
