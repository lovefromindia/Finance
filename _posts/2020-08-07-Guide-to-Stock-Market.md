**Stock market is a place where people buy and sell <u>Shares of Company</u>. Shares of Company are literally ‘piece’ in ownership of company or ‘some part’ in ownership of company.** 
That is if you are buying shares of Company ‘X’ then you are getting a percentage ownership in Company ‘X’. That means you can be called “co-owner” of company. (Note: Shares and Stock both are interchangeably used for the same thing but we will only use 'share' for representing Part of Ownership)

OK, now brain is generating so many questions like:

- Why the hell companies put their part of ownership of company for selling and buying?
- Why the people buy and sell shares?
- How people take decision when to buy and sell shares of Company? And other questions?



We shall start asking why company put the part of company or ownership of company for selling and buying.

# Need of STOCK MARKET

Suppose you have a pen manufacturing business and your company is a small factory. There you make various types of pens such as gel-pen, ball pen, glitter pen, etc. Now, you run this factory unit since four years from now and your earnings are growing at increasing rate.

But as Humans have no upper limit of satisfaction so you too don’t have. You want to expand your company in different states and countries. You want that your pen to be sold in every country. 

While planning to do so, you feel that for production of pens to be sold at such a level you need to produce the pens in large numbers. You need to setup at least two more factories.

Now, for building factories, you need **LARGE CAPITAL i.e. MONEY**. But obviously you don’t have sufficient money for that.

You have <u>option of business loan from bank</u>. Also it should be noted that the *interest* is too high on business loans. Also it is mandatory to repay interest on loan after fixed intervals. That means banks don’t care whether your business makes money or not, they will be standing at your door after fixed interval to get interest (on loan) from you. That can be bad at a time if in some year your company faces loss. So you don’t need any burden of loans and so you decide to stay away from loans.

Asking from your friend or relative (I would never think to do this as they will instead starts to ask me for money!!). 

Here comes to your rescue the Stock Market.

# What is STOCK MARKET?

So Stock Market is general word used for *organizations dealing the buying and selling of shares(or stock)*. Majority of countries has one, two or more **STOCK EXCHANGES** for which word Stock Market is used. Here people (general public) can own stocks of company i.e. part of ownership of company. People pay price to buy shares/stock of company by buying shares of company. 

Here you need the money for your pen company but what you have to put some percentage of company on sell. For e.g. You decide to put 35% of company on sell. That means you, after selling shares, will own 65% partnership in company because you have sell part of company and you now have other 35% owned collectively by people(co-owners).

Now money is paid by people in exchange of ownership in your company and that’s where companies raise large amount of money. Here money directly goes to company and then company can use it for company operations.

This is not a loan as you are putting ownership of company on sell permanently. So you don’t have to return interest or money itself back to the people as you are giving them shares of company. 

*This is like you have co-owners of company because they too have piece of ownership by having shares.*

The buyers of shares of company are called **Shareholders** of that company. That makes sense as they hold the share in ownership of your company.

![Share representation](\Finance\assets\images\Pic3.PNG)

So now you understand,

# Why the hell companies put their part of ownership of company for selling?

Just because **<u> they need money for expansion and growth of business </u>** and loans are a kind of burden way of getting money.

Yeah you will say hey in stock market companies have to give away some part of ownership in company, that’s not bad?

Not here because if you need large capital for expansion then for earning the amount your company needs to make more sales and for more sales your company needs more exposure and that again brings you to expansion. So you are caught in loop here. You need Money in the first place for expansion.

The main advantage is that large amount of money can be raised and can be used for expansion. That expansion makes companies more profitable than before.

In this Stock Exchange, companies raise money for expansion and growth. But for that, they have to register your company on the Stock Exchange so they include your company for buyers to buy. This is called that your company is **going public** meaning now public (other people besides you) can own a part of your company. Your ABC PEN company is selling its ownership in Stock Markets (IPO) for the first time to public that’s called the **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**. IPO just means that company is selling its shares for first time to public through Stock Market.

## What is meant when a company sells share for IPO?

As we have learn earlier, companies, sell some part of ownership of company as shares.

- But what does the share represent:               

- Does it mean people own company's factory or machines or land?

- Does it mean that you(Owner of ABC PEN Company) have to give away your machines to people forever?

  ![Don't Work This Way](\Finance\assets\images\Pic4.PNG)

![Don't Work This Way](\Finance\assets\images\Pic5.PNG)

Selling of some Part of Ownership doesn’t mean that you can’t use or authorize some part your factory or company. Also doesn’t mean shareholders can use machinery, things which belong to company just like that. NO!!

Actually no shareholders or not any individual own completely a single thing. All things are co-owned by Actual Owner and Shareholders. Even there is real estate property of company then that would have a lot of owners as ownership will be divided on basis of shareholding. So as everything(of company) is owned by every shareholder therefore a single shareholder can’t use company’s owned things for his/her personal use as it doesn’t belongs to him/her only. All belongings of company are used for betterment of company only.

Everything remains same for a company from the work they do and the employee who works in it. The change is seen afterwards is that now company is not owned by a solo owner, small group of people but anyone who has shares of company can be co-owner. And that makes a hell lot difference.

## Difference Before And After Selling Shares

That means very major development in your company would have impacts not only on you. Also profit you earn in your company is not limited to you. If you took a wrong decision due to which your company’s profit decreases, then you alone will not be impacted but other shareholders will feel impact. (Don’t worry we will see why shareholders gets affected)

Before IPO, you can decide what’s right for the company and yours decision was the last decision. But from now on wards, you not only have to inform the buyers of your company’s shares about the decisions in your company but also you have to tell about every major development in company, details of every meeting you do with your company employees, earnings of your company, potential risks in your company in near future like increasing/decreasing of sales, decreasing of profit, loans taken by company in past or any plan to take any loan in future etc.

It’s much more like you have co-owners of your company after selling. And if you have co-owners then you have to tell them everything you know about the company.

You said that people can be co-owners but, 

## How much percentage of company do shareholders actually own?

It depends on **number of shares**.

For e.g. A company is divided into 100 shares. So having 1 share of company means to have own 1% of company. But if a company is divided into 10 shares, then having 1 share means to have whooping 10% ownership. So, in general,

(Don’t worry about the term ‘outstanding’. I will tell you about it in some later blog.)

To relate it with our world, let’s take example of Indian company ‘TITAN’. It has total shares (as of when I write this blog) 887,786,160 shares. So even if a person owns 1000 share, he would only own 0.000112% ownership.

# Why people buy stocks of company at IPO?

> **People buy shares of company just to sell them in future at higher price than for what they have got them.** 

If you sell a thing at a price higher than at what you bought then you have earned profit on that thing. Yes believe it or not people buy and sell shares and difference in price of shares at buying and selling is their earning. People can have loss if they buy shares at high price but sell them at low price and can have profit if they buy at low price and sell at high price.

But remember that company after buying doesn’t get any penny from these transactions of share. The only time company gets direct money is at the time of IPO when they sold shares for the first time. After this, people who have them/or not, can buy/sell them as per their will and it is each individual’s profit or loss at time of buying/selling.

The IPO is just beginning of Journey of Shares in Stock Market. After the IPO, company's shares are constantly bought and sold in Stock Market among people. The buyer of shares at IPO can sell shares (if they want) and the people, who had not bought shares at IPO can buy it, from the people who have shares and wants to sell. 

​                                                                **<u>Two Terminologies used in Finance:-</u>**

The initial buying happens at IPO and it’s also called **‘Primary Market'** as it is the primary source of shares of company.

After that shareholders can buy and sell shares through Stock Exchange. Here the shares, which are available from IPO (Primary Market), are exchanged(sold or bought). It is called **‘Secondary Market'**.

Just a little bit correction:-

For keeping it simple I have written that shares are bought and sold at Stock Exchanges but this is a half story. At Stock Exchange, a <u>Buyer gets Seller</u> of shares as per his <u>demanded price or nearby price</u>. And <u>Seller gets Buyer</u> of shares which are ready to give <u>price or nearby price demanded by seller</u>. This way order of shares is matched at Stock Exchange. But people do sell/buy shares through Stock Brokerages which provide interface for people to buy or sell shares. Keep this in mind for now.

## Why Price of Shares Increase/Decrease in Secondary Market?

Now you might ask why the share's price will increase or decrease due to which people buy or sell shares in Secondary Market. The concept is “**DEMAND AND SUPPLY**”. Demand and Supply is the reason behind price fluctuation of any commodity or shares of company.

> If there is limited supply of good or service but have greater demand, then price of that product or service increases. 

> If demand of product is less and supply is more, as a result price of product or services decreases.

We all have used this fact at least once in life. For e.g. when I was child, my parents never took me for first day first show of any movie. Instead we always go after 15 – 20 days. Because we all know if a large scale movie of superstar is releasing, all people want to watch it immediately on weekend when it is released. Now people are obviously in larger number than number of seats. As there are limited seats in theater and more people are willing to see it, theater owners don’t hesitate to increase ticket rates for the film. Due to this some people who were ready to pay the previous price, now are not willing to pay the higher price. So number of people who want to see film at weekend becomes more or less equal to number of seats. But after 15-20 days, the excitement to watch it gets down, and not more people come to theater. So to attract people to watch the new film, again ticket rates are decreased to a great extent. (During this period your author goes out with parents to enjoy film)

Now coming back to share market, here the only good is shares of company.

​                                                                       **Scenario 1:**

Price of shares increases when there is demand of shares and few sellers of shares. So sellers will demand a higher price for shares as few shares are there for selling. But if they sellers demands too much then also the buyers would be discouraged to buy shares. So in this bargaining, both buyers and sellers will come to a price which is favorable for both parties but obviously that price would be the more than original price of that share.

Here sellers sell shares because they <u>think</u> that demand created at present will ultimately decrease in future. Therefore selling in future would mean selling at low price (as less demand than present). So they prefer to sell it at present.

Here buyers will <u>think</u> that this increasing demand is not the upper limit but demand will further increase so price in future will be more than today. So they will buy at present and will sell at even higher price in future.

But we know from these two thinking only one remains in long run as price of share will either increase or decrease in future.

​                                                                    **Scenario 2:**

Price of shares decreases when there is less demand or decreasing demand. So due to less demand people will start to sell their shares while most of other people would avoid buying shares due to decreasing demand. So sellers of that share will be more than buyers. So sellers have to decrease price for share so that few people get attracted to cheaper price to buy that share.

Here sellers <u>thinks</u> that demand of share has decreased and cannot regain the higher price again (so cannot regain the demand again)  so selling at present low price will cause them less loss than by selling in future at even lesser price.

Here buyers will buy at low prices even if there is decreasing demand because these people <u>think</u> that the demand of these share will rise in future so low buy (at present) and selling high (in future) will cause them to earn profit.

But again, we know from these two thinking only one remains in long run as price of share will either increase or decrease in future.

Note how in above paragraphs I have highlighted the word <u>'think'</u> multiple times. You can see <u>people think of future demand</u> and take decisions of whether to buy or sell the share. So this brings us to last question that what leads people to 'thinking' about share i.e. how people develop opinion about whether to buy or sell share.

- How people 'think' about future price or future demand of share? or

- How people think about future ‘Demand’?

# How People Decide When to Buy or Sell Shares of Company?

So far we have talked about how people earns by selling and buying of shares of company. The price of shares changes due to change in demand of shares.

Now, the demands of shares of company directly reflect the demand for company in market. Shares actually represent the underlying company. If company is in demand then its shares will be in demand.

Now if I am buyer of share of your ABC PEN company. Then I would study about your company. I would see if your company has bright future or not.

## Why future of Company?

 Because if your company will grow in future then more people in future will be eager to buy ownership of profitable company. These buyers that we are talking about exist in future. In future these buyers will buy the share at higher price because at that time they would have similar thinking as what I have now as present buyer. Then I can sell my shares in future at higher price and can have profit earned. So shares are bought at present to sell in future at higher price. Now if demand of that share is decreased then buyer of that share i.e. I may have to sell it at an lower price(compared to buying price at present) and have a loss. Therefore,

 *Everyone while buying shares of any company actually buys them based on their estimated increased demand in future or near future*.

## How People can predict Company's Future? 

Imagine if i can predict that your ABC Pen Company's Shares' price will increase in future then, i would immediately buy them at present and would sell them in future. But this is not possible.

No one, yes “no one” can predict the future of company’s growth with 100% correctness. But we can have certainty that company will grow or not. The certainty of company's growth is decided on tools available at present. This is very similar practice we do many times in our life. 

Like if there is a good rainfall then during that year vegetables and fruit will not have much higher price and will have stable price. It is simply due to the fact that farmers will have good harvest of crops so we will have sufficient fruit and vegetables.  

If winter is ending and summer is coming then you would choose winter to buy Air Conditioner rather than going in summer and pay increased price. 

If Dad is silent and continuously looking to you then you could predict that ‘How to Live Life’ lecture series is going to come for you. 

Hey but what kind of information is available at present which can be useful to predict future growth?  

## Financial Report of Company

Recall that in IPO paragraph we had discussed that after IPO, you have to share all details of your ABC PEN company’s earnings, profits, losses, loans etc. This is included in what’s called company’s **‘FINANCIAL REPORTS’**. As the name suggests, it has all financial details of company. In this, every company has to transparently show all single details of company including profits, loss, yearly growth of company, financial position of company i.e. how much debt it has to pay, interest on those debts. And that report is made available to everyone because anyone of the general public can be buyer or seller of share of company. So, anyone can access and reads the company’s growth and financial statements of company.

Now Let's see clearly what makes a person to trade shares of a company:

Due to consistence hard work, your ABC PEN company expands and now sold more pens and thus income in report is increased than earlier. Now, in your ABC PEN company, all your machines had to be replaced as they were in last stage of their functioning. So your company by taking some loans bought new generation machines that could increase production and reduce cost of production. But, the machines were too expensive that there would be high expenses in reports. Also for almost 2 years company has to pay interest on loans. Due to this, profits would decrease.

TWO MAIN POINTS TO DRAW FROM YOUR COMPANY’S REPORT:

- INCREASE IN INCOME AND SALES


- INCREASE IN EXPENSES AND A DEBT IS TAKEN


We will see TWO TYPES OF THINKING IN THIS STAGE IN MARKETS:

1) ***Seller mindset***: These people will sell their ABC PEN company shares because they think that debt at this stage of company can be harmful. As, if company fails to achieve high income in particular year, then also they have to pay fixed interest amounts to lender which leads to loss for company.  So they think that company’s shares’ demand will decrease and so the price of share will decrease. So, they think that the right thing is to sell shares.

2) ***Buyers and holders:*** These people will either buy shares or hold them if they have already have them. These people think that company’s expenses and profit will surely decrease for few months but due to the new equipment, company’s production capacity will increase. 

In reality People do can do more research for buying/selling shares such as many people also study about you (how many times I should remind you that you are owner of ABC PEN company). People will interested o know that you as owner are honest towards your work or not. By such research only, a decision is made.

Now, <u>if people having sellers’ mindset are more than people having buyer/holder mindset</u>, then at that moment the selling of <u>ABC PEN shares increases</u>.  Also, <u>in addition if the people buying those shares are less than people selling shares</u>, so the <u>price can further decreases</u> due to decreases in demand at that moment. Here you can see that price of share decreases based on <u>speculation of future's growth</u>. I cannot say complete speculation but prediction based on logic and information. Here everybody is trying to predict that whether the company can grow or not based on FINANCIAL REPORT or decisions by company at present and hence buy/sell. But everybody forgets that future growth of company will be seen in future only.

 Now the possible future can be that even if debt is present in your company then also maintains high income in future, then obviously demand and so the price of your company’s shares increases. Here people who holds or buy shares in past would get benefited.

Also the possible future can be that debt can ruin your company in one or two years completely. Then Sellers who had already sold shares in past would get benefited.

So we here learn that there are two types of reaction in Stock Market: 

**1) Immediate moment Reaction** 

**2) Long term Reaction**

1st is short term reaction which causes increase/decrease based upon possible future. Here both seller and buyer are having their own way of thinking about decisions they make. Any of them can be correct as there is probability of company making profit **or** loss. I would not say equal probability but still anyone can be correct as any of the events is not certain or have 100% chance by probability. 

<img src="\Finance\assets\images\Pic7.PNG" alt="Voting machine in short term" style="zoom: 200%;" />

2nd is long term reaction which comes based upon how actual company made growth. Because share at the end of day reflect company’s value so if company performs well then its demand of shares among people will increase and if not performed well then less people would be interested to have that share. 

<img src="\Finance\assets\images\Pic8.PNG" alt="Weighing Machine"/>

![Weighing Machine](\Finance\assets\images\Pic9.PNG)

So it should be noted that, the decision of a individual to buy/sell at his/her present time is correct or not, can only be known in future or near future.

Therefore we can conclude that the demand of shares of company increases/decreases due to the company’s Financial Reports, development and growth. 

For e.g. there is a reputed company that makes crop seeds. But, there is expected less rainfall in a year, so there is probability that farmers will not buy seeds in large number as less rain could destroy crops. So, this seed company will certainly have loss in the upcoming months. So, person holding the shares of this company will probably sell the shares because he thinks that share demand in future will decrease. But, other people might not believe that news and hold the shares. But only one of them might be right about future because the share price will either go up or down than present price. 

News about or related to company can change the share price of company at that moment due to immediate moment reaction but the real effect is of company's earnings and growth which will be seen in long term future only.

 It is true that many people on earth have over the years develop many ways to predict the future of company but none of them is 100% correct. 

*People can be right or wrong but the success in stock market is not about being right or wrong every time but success is when you have right predictions of company’s future more than wrong ones so that net earnings are positive.*
